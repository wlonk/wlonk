### Welcome to me on github

Hi, I'm Kit, he/they. In my coding life, I like Python, Rust, reStructured
Text, and thinking of code as something for humans. I also really like git
surgery.

I'm terrible at writing bios, so instead of making claims about "who I am", let
me talk about "what I do".

#### [Where to Find Me](https://wheretofind.me/)

I made a little calling card for the internet. I apparently made it at the
right time, because a bunch of people like it. I'm glad! I find it useful, and
a good chance to practice my values. I've tried very hard to make sure we're
engaged in humane and ethical design at every turn in it, simple though it may
be.

The code is [here](https://github.com/wlonk/wheretofind.me).

#### [PyTeDjMi](https://github.com/wlonk/pytest-django-migrations)

I want to be able to run tests, under pytest, for my Django data migrations. So
this is a tool to make that easier. It's still under active development; lots
of strange nooks and crannies in the code there.

#### [Phix](https://github.com/wlonk/phix)

A small tool to facilitate writing good Sphinx docs. I think documentation is
very important, and being able to see what your docs will look like can help
you, y'know, write them.

#### Harriet

It's not a thing yet, but soon, I hope, I will have a Django library to make
integrating a WebSocket push notification surface into a Django REST Framework
API easier.

#### [My Dotfiles](https://github.com/wlonk/dotfiles)

I put a bunch of time and care into my dotfiles, and I want them to be easily
accessible when I set up a new laptop. So if I'm storing them here anyway, why
not make them public? Usually when someone asks me how I did a thing in vim, I
just link them to the appropriate section of my `.vimrc`.
